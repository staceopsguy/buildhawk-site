        q: "What does BuildHawk actually do?",
        a: [
          "We run estimating and contract administration for custom residential builders. That means three things: we price the job before it goes under contract, we monitor cost against estimate every month it's on the tools, and we produce a single director-level report that tells the builder if the business is on track.",
          "We are not a software company that bolts on services. We are a contract administration practice that built the software we needed. Hawktress™ is the cost intelligence layer that sits behind every estimate.",

      {
        q: "Who is BuildHawk for?",
        a: [
          "Custom residential builders in Australia running between 4 and 30 active jobs at any time. The methodology applies across knockdown rebuilds, custom new builds and substantial renovations on contracts between $600k and $4m.",

        q: "Who runs BuildHawk?",
        a: [

        q: "How does an engagement start?",
        a: [
          "A 30-minute discovery call. We look at three things: contract structure across the active book, last twelve months of variations, and how cost is currently tracked between estimate and final account. If the methodology is going to add more than its fee, we say so. If it is not, we say that too.",

      {
        q: "What does it cost?",
        a: [
          "We publish three engagement tiers on the pricing page. Pricing scales with the active book size — the number of jobs we monitor and the volume of estimating produced. Most builders engage on a 12-month minimum so the methodology has time to compound across at least two full project cycles.",
        ],
      },
      {
        q: "Can I trial it on a single job?",
        a: [
          "No. The methodology only works when applied across the whole active book. A single job in a system that is otherwise unchanged tells you nothing about whether the engagement is working. We need to see the variance trend across at least four jobs to demonstrate value.",

        q: "Do you replace my contract administrator?",
        a: [
          "No. We replace the spreadsheet and the gut feel. Your CA still runs the job day to day. We give them a cost framework that flags problems while they can still be solved, and a reporting cadence that protects them from being blamed for things they could not see.",

        q: "What is the 5% variance threshold?",
        a: [

          "It is not a contingency, a markup buffer or a pricing allowance. It is a tolerance band. The point of the band is to surface a problem while a decision is still possible — absorb, recover or escalate. At 15% across multiple sections nobody caught, none of those decisions are available.",
        ],

        q: "Why monthly? Why not weekly?",
        a: [
