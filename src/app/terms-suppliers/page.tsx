          standards. Member Suppliers may be invited to participate in

      <h2>4. Performance standards</h2>

        Hawktress monitors supplier performance against a 5% variance threshold
        across all stages of the project lifecycle, including initial quotes,
        variation claims and final invoiced amounts versus PO values. A
        Supplier whose pricing consistently exceeds the threshold will be
        flagged internally and notified before any action is taken. BuildHawk
        reserves the right to add a performance note to the Supplier profile,
        remove recommendation status, or suspend the subscription with 30 days
        written notice.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Competitive requirement</h2>
      <p>
        Suppliers are admitted on the basis that their pricing is competitive
        within their nominated regions and trade category across all project
        stages. BuildHawk reserves the right to review platform eligibility at
        any time.

        non-renewal. BuildHawk may terminate immediately if the Supplier
