        any subscription fee, the Builder agrees to be bound by these terms.

      <h2>3. Subscription pricing</h2>
      <h3>3.1 Onboarding fee</h3>
      <p>
        A one-off onboarding fee of <strong>$3,500 AUD (ex GST)</strong> is
        payable before onboarding commences. Non-refundable.
      </p>
      <h3>3.2 Subscription tiers and payment options</h3>
      <p>
        All subscriptions are available as <strong>annual (paid upfront)</strong>{" "}
        or <strong>monthly instalments</strong>. The monthly instalment option

        an annual payment.

      <h3>3.3 Additional project fee</h3>
      <p>
        The additional project fee of $1,850 is a flat fee charged per project
        when a new active project is created beyond the included allowance. It
        applies equally to annual and monthly subscribers and is not subject to
        discount. A project is considered active from the date it is created
        until BuildHawk marks it as Completed.
      </p>
      <h3>3.4 Value reference</h3>
      <p>
        A full-time senior estimator and contract administrator in Australia
        costs between $280,000 and $342,000 per year in combined salary,
        superannuation at 12.5%, WorkCover at 4%, leave entitlements and
        recruitment fees. Hawktress delivers estimating intelligence,
        pre-construction benchmarking, variation control, live project cost
        tracking and monthly commercial reporting across multiple active
        projects at a materially lower total cost.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Contract administration and variation control</h2>
      <p>
        Where a Builder engages BuildHawk's contract administration service, the
        following rules apply within Hawktress:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Every variation claim is assessed against the regional 5% variance
          threshold before the CA approves it
        </li>
        <li>
          Any variation that exceeds the threshold is flagged and referred to
          the BuildHawk Director for approval before the CA can proceed
        </li>
        <li>
          All variations, POs and committed costs are tracked in Hawktress in
          real time
        </li>
        <li>
          The Builder receives a monthly report covering all active jobs and a
          company financial snapshot, due by the 5th of each month
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Monthly director report</h2>
      <p>The monthly report covers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Each active job: original contract value, current contract value,
          committed costs, forecast final cost, gross margin, variations
          approved that month and programme status
        </li>
        <li>
          Company financial snapshot: total contracted revenue, total revenue
          received, total committed costs, portfolio gross margin, outstanding
          invoices, aged debtors and 30, 60 and 90-day revenue forecast
        </li>
        <li>Escalation items requiring Builder decision or approval</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Output and branding</h2>
      <p>
        All Hawktress outputs use the Builder's brand kit.{" "}
        <strong>"Powered by Hawktress"</strong> and the BuildHawk logo appear as
        a fixed, non-removable element on all outputs. This requirement is
        mandatory and is not subject to variation regardless of the Builder's
        brand preferences.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Data obligations</h2>
      <ul>
